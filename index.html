        <p>
          Since you’re here, you probably know why, but let’s go over the
          advantages of Python quickly! Python is one of the world’s most used
          and most popular programming languages. It’s powerful, versatile, and
          easy to learn. Python is widely used in various applications, some
          notable ones:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web Development</li>
          <li>Data Science</li>
          <li>Data Analysis</li>
          <li>Machine Learning</li>
          <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
          <li>Scripting and tooling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many people say that <b>Python comes with batteries included</b>. It’s
          a fun way to state that it includes a comprehensive base library. In
          addition, because so many people use Python, hundreds of thousands of
          high-quality libraries and frameworks exist to get things done quickly
          and without hassle. You can do a lot with a little bit of Python code!
          Learning Python is a no-brainer, and I promise you will be up and
          running quickly with this Python tutorial. Regardless of your future
          in IT, it will be a helpful tool to have in your toolbox!

          The first bit of code we will write is "Hello World! Open up the
          Scratchpad and try it yourself!

        <header><h3>Variables in Python</h3></header>
        <p>
          Python variables are simply containers for storing data values. Unlike
          other languages, such as Java, Python has no command for declaring a
          variable, so you create one the moment you first assign a value to it.
          Python variables are simply containers for storing data values.
        </p>
        <code
          >x = 45
          <br />
          y = "john"
          <br />
          print( y, x)
        </code>
        <p>
          Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can
          even change type after they have been set.

        <header><h3>Data Types</h3></header>
        <p>
          In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store
          data of different types, and different types can do different things.
          Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these
          categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text type: str</li>
          <li>Numeric types: int, float, complex</li>
          <li>Sequence types: list, tuple, range</li>
          <li>mapping types: dict</li>
          <li>Set types: set, frozenset</li>
          <li>Boolean types: bool</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="dictionaries">
        <header><h3>Dictionaries</h3></header>
        <p>
          Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A
          dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not
          allow duplicates. As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered.
          In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
        </p>
        <code
          >thisdict = { "brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964 }
